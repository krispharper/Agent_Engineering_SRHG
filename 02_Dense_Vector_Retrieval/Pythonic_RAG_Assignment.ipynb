    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicity's sake."

      "Hello! The best way to write a loop in Python depends on what you want to achieve. Generally, Python offers two main types of loops:\n",

      "2. **`while` loops** – used when you want to repeat something as long as a certain condition holds true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a quick guideline:\n",
      "\n",
      "### For Loop (recommended for known iterations or iterables)\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for item in iterable:\n",
      "    # Do something with item\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for i in range(5):\n",
      "    print(i)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### While Loop (useful when the number of iterations is not known)\n",
      "```python\n",
      "while condition:\n",
      "    # Do something\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want something simple and readable, `for` loops are generally preferred for iterating over elements. If your loop depends on some dynamic condition, a `while` loop might be better.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Long-Term Treasure Hunting Mindset**: The letter opens with an analogy to treasure hunting, referencing Mel Fisher’s relentless search for the Nuestra Señora de Atocha shipwreck over many years. This suggests a theme of patient, persistent pursuit of valuable investment opportunities that are “waiting” rather than lost, emphasizing a long-term and disciplined approach to investing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Operational Excellence and Scale in Energy Production**: The letter discusses Stone Ridge Energy (SRE), highlighting its ambition to become a top three U.S. producer of hydrocarbons through “disciplined acquisitions, careful development, and unrelenting process improvement.” This reflects a theme of investing in operationally excellent enterprises that manage large-scale capital and production efficiently, with an emphasis on practical impact on the U.S. economy, families, and factories.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **American Capital for American Treasure**: The letter notes that more than 99% of the capital managed by Stone Ridge, including SRE, comes from American investors. This theme underscores an alignment of interests between American investors and impactful domestic production, suggesting a patriotic or civic-minded investment philosophy where capital contributes directly to the competitiveness and practical infrastructure of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Fresh Thinking and Innovation**: Although not fleshed out in detail, the letter mentions “leveraging nature” and bringing “fresh thinking” to the company’s operations, indicating a theme of innovation and evolving business models over time. The letter envisions Stone Ridge evolving into “a different kind of company” in five years, implying adaptability and forward-looking strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Philosophical and Analytical Rigor**: Quotes appearing in the letter from notable figures—such as Ayrton Senna on pushing limits, Elon Musk on optimism, and a humorous Michael Scott reference on Bayesian priors—suggest a culture valuing bravery, optimism, learning, and thoughtful analysis. The phrase \"OUTPHILOSOPHIZING\" reflects a mindset of rigorous intellectual approach and continuous improvement in investment thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Caution Regarding Investment Communications**: As noted in Source 3, the letter clarifies it does not constitute formal investment advice or a guarantee of future results, highlighting a theme of careful, transparent communication about the inherent uncertainties in investing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the key investment themes are: disciplined, long-term value pursuit akin to treasure hunting; building scale and operational excellence in energy production with significant domestic impact; innovation and adaptation; intellectual rigor; and a strong alignment with American capital and economic competitiveness.\n",

    "Enhance your Stone Ridge Investor Letter Assistant in some way! \n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Document Support**: Allow it to ingest multiple investor letters from different years for historical comparison\n",
    "- **New Distance Metric**: Implement a different similarity measure - does it improve retrieval for financial content?\n",
    "- **Metadata Support**: Add metadata like year, topic categories (market outlook, strategy, performance) to help filter results\n",
    "- **Different Embedding Model**: Try a different embedding model - does domain-specific tuning help for financial content?\n",
    "- **Multi-Source Ingestion**: Add the capability to ingest content from SEC filings, earnings calls, or other financial documents\n",
    "\n",
    "While these are suggestions, you should feel free to make whatever augmentations you desire! Think about what features would make this investor letter assistant most useful for understanding Stone Ridge's investment approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're finished making the augments to your RAG application - vibe check it against the old one - see if you can \"feel the improvement\"!\n",

    "> NOTE: These additions might require you to work within the `aimakerspace` library - that's expected!\n",
